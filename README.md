This is a visualizer for gravity lines and the distortions that happen when an object with immense mass exist. It also acts as a black hole simulator, as the black hole evaporates with time, data shown on the top-left corner. You can see how distortions lessen as the black hole starts to evaporate (therefore lose mass).

I mainly created this project because the concept is extremely hard to wrap your head around at first. Gravity is not a force, its space-time curvature bending around an object with immense mass. People often demonstrate this with a tramboline to others. I believe it makes the topic even more confusing. This kind of visualization helps people better and more easily understand this concept about bent space-time, as everything clicked once I saw this kind of visualization on YouTube. This is basically an interactive demo about this topic.

Keep in mind that this is computationally heavy. Do NOT go overboard with grid scale parameters.
